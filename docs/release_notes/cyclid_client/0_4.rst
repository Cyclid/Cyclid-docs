Cyclid Client 0.4

.. contents::

v0.4.0
======

Changes
-------

- Added the ``job stats`` and ``job list`` commands to show the number of jobs,
  and list the details of all jobs.
- Added the ``user authenticate`` command to log in to a server with a
  username & password and automatically download & create configuration files
  for every organization the user is a member of. Requires a server running
  at Cyclid 0.4.0 or newer.
- Full support for HTTPS for all API calls; the ``url`` and ``use_tls``
  configurations options have been added. 
- Plugable output formatters and better support for output to things that are
  not terminals E.g. piping output to ``less`` will no longer produce XTerm
  control characters in the output.

New methods
-----------

- ``Job::job_stats`` to retrieve job statistics for an organization.
- ``Job::job_list`` to retrieve a list of jobs.
