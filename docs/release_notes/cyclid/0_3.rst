Upgrading
=========

Refer to the standard instructions for :ref:`upgrading <upgrading>` from a
previous release of Cyclid.

v0.3.0
======

Highlights
----------

This is the first release with support for logic modifiers. The
implementation of Sequences has been fixed to work as documented, so you no
longer need to declare ``on_success`` handlers for every Stage. The Github API,
Debian & Ubuntu Provisioner plugins have all seen updates & bug fixes.

Changes
-------

- Add the ``only_if`` and ``not_if`` :ref:`modifiers <modifiers-info>`.
- Sequences now follow the documented behaviour: if no explicit ``on_success``
  handler is defined, the next stage in the sequence will run automatically
  (if the Stage succeeds)
- Pull Request events from forked Github repositories now work, and the logic
  for Github Pull Requests has been generally improved.
- Quietened & cleaned up the Debian & Ubuntu Provisioner output when running
  ``apt`` commands.
- All context variable interpolation is now "safe" and will not raise an error
  if the variable being interpolated does not exist.
